# FrodoKEM-shake-640

Implemented according to [this paper](https://frodokem.org/files/FrodoKEM-specification-20200325.pdf).

## Install

```shell
make
```

Will build three targets : `frodokeygen`, `frodoencaps` and `frododecaps`.

Unfortunately for now, it doesn't seem to work.

## Tests

todo : provide some tests using [these known values](https://github.com/microsoft/PQCrypto-LWEKE/blob/master/FrodoKEM/KAT/PQCkemKAT_19888_shake.rsp).

Code implemented for the "Advanced Cryptology" course at École polytechnique by Rémi Germe.
